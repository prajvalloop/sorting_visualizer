# sorting_visualizer
We are all aware of many sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and so on, but we frequently fail to comprehend the algorithms due to a lack of visual information. This React Web-App will assist you in visualising these algorithms for better understanding. We started this project because we were always fascinated that the concept of organization could be so easily captured within algorithms, as well as the fact that some core mathematical principles can make some incredibly-fast algorithms.
